# EAGLE 8 Schematics "First Steps" (do every time you start a new project)/

2018/01/26 - From the `eaglecad-things` repo (written for EAGLE 8.6.0).

## Control Panel

- Run EAGLE.
- The Control Panel should open up.

## On every new or opening schematic, do:

- Control+1 to set the right layers in the schematic.
- IMPORTANT: Set the grid to something sane:
   -Type `grid 0.05 2 alt 0.05 on` (Make the grid 0.05 inches. Make the visible grid 2 x 0.05 = 0.1 inches. Turn off the alternative grid.).
- Add a frame
   - Type "Add"
   - Go to the Frames library
   - Choose "A" size, or "Letter" or "11 x 17".
   - Place the frame at the origin (cross symbol) -- this turns out to be important later.
